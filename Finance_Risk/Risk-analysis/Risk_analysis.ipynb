    "\n",
    "Risk analysis is about looking at possible risks and understanding how they might affect a company, project, or decision. It involves figuring out what the risks are, thinking about how serious they could be, and deciding what to do about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Varius products of the banking sector**\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks provide many different products and services to meet the financial needs of individuals, businesses, and institutions. Here are some examples of what banks offer: \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 - Credit risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk means the chance of losing money if someone doesn't pay back what they owe. It happens when borrowers or others can't pay back loans or do what they promised. To reduce this risk, banks check people's credit, ask for things to guarantee loans, spread out loans to different people, and use special financial tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: when a bank lends money to people or businesses, there's a risk they might not pay it back. If someone doesn't pay back what they owe, the bank could lose money.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters used to calaculate credit risk**: To calculate credit risk, several parameters are commonly used. These parameters help assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and estimate the likelihood and potential impact of default. Here are some key parameters used in credit risk analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Probability of Default (PD)**: PD is a measure used in finance to estimate the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their financial obligations, such as repaying a loan or debt, within a specific time frame. It is often expressed as a percentage and is based on various factors including historical data, credit ratings, financial indicators, and other relevant information. PD helps financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and manage the risk associated with lending money.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical Method: PD = (Number of Defaults within a specific time period) / (Total Number of Observations within the same time period)\n",
    "- Credit Rating Transition Matrix Method: PD = (Probability of Transition from Non-Default Rating to Default Rating) * (Probability of Default Rating)\n",
    "- Merton Model  \n",
    "\n",
    "**- Loss Given Default (LGD)**: LGD estimates the potential loss that a lender may incur if a borrower defaults. It represents the portion of the outstanding loan or credit exposure that is unlikely to be recovered in the event of default. LGD is typically expressed as a percentage of the exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Direct Method: LGD = (Total Exposure - Recovered Amount) / Total Exposure\n",
    "- Workout Method: LGD = (Total Loss - Recovered Amount) / Total Exposure\n",
    "- Statistical Method: LGD = 1 - Recovery Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Exposure at Default (EAD)**: EAD refers to the total amount of exposure that a lender has to a borrower at the time of default. It represents the maximum potential loss that can occur if a borrower defaults. EAD includes the outstanding loan balance, unused credit lines, and other forms of exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple Approach: EAD = Outstanding Loan Balance + Undrawn Credit Lines\n",
    "- Basel Approach: EAD = Exposure Value x Credit Conversion Factor (CCF)\n",
    "- Advanced Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Credit Rating**: Credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies provide an indication of a borrower's creditworthiness. Ratings assess the likelihood of default and can help lenders gauge the level of credit risk associated with a borrower. Common rating scales include AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, C, with each category representing different levels of creditworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Financial Ratios and Indicators**: Various financial ratios and indicators are used to assess the financial health and stability of borrowers. These may include\n",
    "\n",
    "- debt-to-equity ratio,\n",
    "- current ratio,\n",
    "- profitability indicators,\n",
    "- cash flow analysis,\n",
    "\n",
    "and other metrics that provide insights into the borrower's ability to meet their financial obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Collateral and Guarantees**: The presence of collateral or guarantees can mitigate credit risk. Collateral refers to assets provided by the borrower that can be used to recover losses in case of default. Guarantees are commitments from third parties to fulfill the borrower's obligations if they default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Industry and Economic Factors**: Credit risk analysis also considers industry-specific factors and macroeconomic conditions that may impact a borrower's ability to repay debts. Factors such as market trends, regulatory changes, and economic indicators are taken into account to evaluate credit risk\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 - Market risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Market risk, also known as systemic risk, is the potential for the value of an investment to be affected by changes in market factors such as asset prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and other macroeconomic factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Market risk affects a wide range of financial assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: An investment fund holding a portfolio of stocks is exposed to market risk. If the stock prices decline due to market downturns, the fund's value may decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used market risk models and methodologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Value at Risk (VaR)**: VaR is a widely used measure for estimating potential losses due to market risk. It quantifies the maximum loss within a specified confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%) over a defined time horizon. VaR can be calculated using historical data, parametric models (such as variance-covariance models), or Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Expected Shortfall (ES)**: Also known as Conditional VaR, ES estimates the average loss beyond the VaR level. It provides additional information about the tail risk and potential losses beyond the confidence level captured by VaR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Stress Testing**: Stress testing involves subjecting a financial portfolio or institution to extreme scenarios to assess the impact on market risk exposures. Stress tests help evaluate the vulnerability of portfolios to adverse market conditions and assess capital adequacy under severe scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Historical Simulation**: This method uses historical market data to estimate potential losses. It involves constructing a portfolio's profit and loss distribution based on past market movements and calculating the losses at specified confidence levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Monte Carlo Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulation generates multiple random scenarios based on modeled assumptions for market variables. By simulating thousands of potential scenarios, it provides a distribution of possible portfolio outcomes and helps estimate potential losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Risk Factor Sensitivity Analysis**: This analysis examines the impact of changes in individual risk factors on the portfolio's value or returns. It helps identify which market variables have the most significant influence on the portfolio's risk and allows for targeted risk management actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Risk Measures for Specific Instruments**: Different market risk models and methodologies are used for specific financial instruments, such as interest rate risk models for fixed income securities, option pricing models for equity options, or commodity price models for commodity derivatives. These models consider the unique characteristics and sensitivities of each instrument to assess market risk exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Value Adjustments (XVA)**: XVAs are adjustments made to the value of derivatives and other financial instruments to account for counterparty credit risk, funding costs, and other risk factors. XVAs are calculated using models that incorporate market risk factors along with credit risk and funding cost components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 - Liquidity risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquidity risk refers to the possibility that an entity may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to the inability to convert assets into cash quickly and without significant losses. This can occur when there is a lack of buyers or sellers in the market for a specific asset, or when the market as a whole becomes illiquid due to adverse economic conditions or unforeseen events. Liquidity risk can affect both individuals and financial institutions, and it is important to manage it properly to ensure financial stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A mutual fund holding illiquid assets, such as real estate or private equity, may face liquidity risk if investors want to redeem their shares, but the fund struggles to sell the underlying assets quickly.\n",
    "\n",
